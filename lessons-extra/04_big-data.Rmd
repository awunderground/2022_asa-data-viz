# Big Data

Our examples thus far have focused on data sets with a modest number of observations and variables. Larger data sets can create new challenges. 

-----

## Challenge 1: Overplotting

*Overplotting* is when some geometric objects in a data visualization obscure other geometric objects. Overplotting is common when there is a highly frequent observation, if there is a lack of precision, or too many observations. 

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.height = 3}
library(patchwork)

# frequent observations
plot1 <- mpg %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x = cyl, y = hwy)) +
  labs(subtitle = "Frequent Observations")

# lack of precision
set.seed(1)
plot2 <- tibble(
  x = rpois(n = 10000, lambda = 10),
  y = rpois(n = 10000, lambda = 10)
) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(subtitle = "Lack of Precision")

# too many observations
plot3 <- diamonds %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = carat, y = price)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(subtitle = "Too Many Observations")

plot1 + plot2 + plot3

```

-----

## Challenge 2: Too many pairwise comparisons

If $m$ is the number of variables in a data set, then there are $\frac{m(m - 1)}{2}$ pairwise relationships in a data set. 

```{r}
tibble(m = 2:200) %>%
  mutate(`Pairwise Relationships` = m * (m - 1) / 2) %>%
  ggplot(aes(m, `Pairwise Relationships`)) +
  geom_line() + 
  labs(
    title = "The Number of Pairwise Relationships Explodes in Modestly Wide Data",
    x = "m (Number of predictors)"
  ) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma)

```

# Overplotting

### `r kableExtra::text_spec("Exercise 1", color = "#1696d2")`

A data set doesn't need thousands of observations to have overplotting. Consider a simple example using the `mpg` data set from `library(ggplot2)`. 

<font color="#55b748">Step 1:</font> Create this plot using the `mpg` data set with variables `cyl` and `hwy`. 

```{r echo = FALSE}
mpg %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(cyl, hwy))

```

<font color="#55b748">Step 2:</font> Use `nrow(mpg)` to count the number of observations in `mpg`. Is there overplotting?

<font color="#55b748">Step 3:</font> Replace `geom_point()` with `geom_jitter()`. What happens?

<font color="#55b748">Step 4:</font> Experiment with the `width` and `height` arguments. You can see the documentation with `?geom_jitter`. What seems to be the best "best" combination?

The first pillar in The Seven Pillars of Statistical Wisdon by Stephen Stigler identifies an interesting paradox: 

>"By aggregating, you lose the identity of the individual, so you’re throwing away information, but you’re also gaining information of a different sort. No one wants to be reduced to a statistic, but by losing the identity of the individual, you are producing information about the group."

`geom_jitter()` creates a similar paradox. Just like how we gain information by throwing out information with aggregation, we can gain clarity by introducing errors to our data with `geom_jitter()`. 

-----

### `r kableExtra::text_spec("Exercise 2", color = "#1696d2")`

Now we'll focus on the `diamonds` data set from `library(ggplot2)`. It contains information about 53,940 diamonds.

```{r}
glimpse(diamonds)

```

Jittering helps with overplotting with modestly sized data sets. It is not helpful with larger data sets. Let's look at the diamonds data set with jitter:

```{r fig.height = 3}
without_jitter <- diamonds %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = carat, y = price)) +
  geom_jitter() +
  labs(subtitle = "Without Jitter")

with_jitter <- diamonds %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = carat, y = price)) +
  geom_jitter() +
  labs(subtitle = "With Jitter")

without_jitter + with_jitter

```

<font color="#55b748">Step 1:</font> Create a scatter plot with the diamonds data set that shows the relationship between `carat` and `price`. 

<font color="#55b748">Step 2:</font> Try the following changes:

* Change the size of points with the `size` argument in `geom_point()`.
* Change to hollow points with `shape = 1` in `geom_point()`.
* Add transparency to points with `alpha = 0.1` in `geom_point()`.
* Use `facet_wrap()` and `facet_grid()`
* Try sampling with the following:

```
diamonds %>% 
  slice_sample(n = 1000) %>%
  ggplot() + ...

```

<font color="#55b748">Step 3:</font> Which do you prefer? What did you learn about the `diamonds` data set with these different techniques?

-----

### `r kableExtra::text_spec("Exercise 3", color = "#1696d2")`

We'll continue with the `diamonds` data set. This time we'll experiment with some summaries instead of visualizing all observations directly. 

<font color="#55b748">Step 1:</font> Create a scatter plot with the diamonds data set that shows the relationship between `carat` and `price`. 

<font color="#55b748">Step 2:</font> Try the following changes:

* Use `geom_hex()` instead of `geom_point()` for multi-dimensional binning with hexagons. Experiment with different values for the argument `bins`.
* Add `geom_smooth()` to add a model on top of the points. 

-----

### Wide Data Summary

Overplotting is a major challenge even with modestly sized data. There are at least three causes for the problem:

1. Frequent values
2. Lack of precision
3. Many observations

We've explored some solutions to overplotting, but the right solution depends on the cause of the overplotting:

* Adding noise works for frequent values and lack of precision, but does not work for many observations.
* Faceting can help with all three causes depending on the data.
* Adding transparency almost always helps.
* Binning the data or adding summaries doesn't add much clarity for frequent values or lack of precision, but is essential for very large data sets.
* Sampling is also a useful tool when interested in general trends, but sampling can obscure anomalies, rare events, and uncommon relationships.

# Wide Data

Techniques for visualizing wide data, and dimension reduction more broadly, are far less settled in the literature. 

-----

### `r kableExtra::text_spec("Exercise 4", color = "#1696d2")`

Approach 1: parallel coordinate plots (Inselberg 1985)

<font color="#55b748">Step 1:</font> Install and load the `GGally` package. 

<font color="#55b748">Step 2:</font> Use the following code to get a subset of observations from the diamonds data set. 

```
diamonds %>%
  select(where(is.numeric), cut) %>%
  slice_sample(n = 50)

```

<font color="#55b748">Step 3:</font> Pipe (`%>%`) the data into `ggparcoord(columns = 1:4)`.

<font color="#55b748">Step 4:</font> Add `alphaLines = 0.3` inside of `ggparcoord()`.

<font color="#55b748">Step 5:</font> Add `groupColumn = 8` inside of `ggparcoord()`.

-----

### `r kableExtra::text_spec("Exercise 5", color = "#1696d2")`

Approach 2: scatterplot matrices (Carr 1985)

<font color="#55b748">Step 1:</font> Install and load the `GGally` package. 

<font color="#55b748">Step 2:</font> Use `select(cty, hwy, year, fl, displ)` to pick a subset of variables from the `mpg` data set. **Warning:** This function will crash R if too many variables are included. 

<font color="#55b748">Step 3:</font> Run `ggpairs()` on the subset of variables from `mpg`.

-----

### `r kableExtra::text_spec("Exercise 6", color = "#1696d2")`

Here we have a data set with 493 votes from two years of the 114th Senate (2015-2017). The data set has 100 rows and 495 columns. An affirmative vote is `1`, a negative vote is `-1`, and an abstention is `0`. The data are from [Bradley Robinson](https://data.world/bradrobinson/us-senate-voting-records) and this example is based on an earlier analysis by Professor Sivan Leviyang. 

<font color="#55b748">Step 1:</font> Load the votes data with

```
votes <- read_csv(here::here("data", "votes.csv"))

```

<font color="#55b748">Step 2:</font> Run PCA with the following code

```{r eval = FALSE}
# select the numeric variables
votes_numeric <- votes %>%
  select_if(is.numeric)

# run PCA
votes_pca <- prcomp(votes_numeric)

# extract the principle components
votes_pcs <- votes_pca %>%
  .$x %>%
  as_tibble()

# combine the pcs to the names and parties
votes_pcs <- bind_cols(
  select(votes, name, party),
  votes_pcs
)

summary(votes_pca)

```

<font color="#55b748">Step 3:</font> Use `x = PC1`, `y = PC2`, and `geom_point()` to plot the data. 

<font color="#55b748">Step 4:</font> Add `party` as color. Try labeling a few individual observations with `geom_text()`. 

<font color="#55b748">Step 5:</font> Add `x` and `y` labels that include the proportion of variation explained by each PC. 

```{r include = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
# plot the data
names <- c("Bernie Sanders", "Ted Cruz", "Joe Manchin", "Susan Collins")

ggplot() +
  geom_point(
    data = votes_pcs, aes(PC1, PC2, color = party),
    alpha = 0.5
  ) +
  geom_text(
    data = filter(votes_pcs, name %in% names), 
    aes(PC1, PC2, label = name)
  ) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("blue", "#228B22", "red")) +
  labs(
    title = "PC1 and PC2 of 114th Senate Votes",
    x = "PC1 (0.63 of Variation)",
    y = "PC2 (0.05 of Variation)"
  ) +
  guides(text = NULL)

```

PCA performs linear dimension reduction. Observations are projected on to a line, plane, or hyperplane. There are non-linear dimension reduction techniques like UMAP, which projects observations on to manifolds, but there techniques are much more difficult to use and are difficult to communicate. 

Other techniques for wide data include but are not limited to:

* t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) (Maaten and Hinton, 2008)
* Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) (Mciness et al., 2018)
* Grand tours (Asimov, 1985)
* Rotating plots (Cook and Miller, 2006)

-----

### Wide Data Summary

Wide data are an even more challenging issue than overplotting. We've seen two options for visualizing many dimensions directly and we've explored one tool for dimension reduction. 

* Parallel coordinate plots
* Pairwise comparison plots
* Dimension reduction
  * PCA
  * t-SNE and UMAP
